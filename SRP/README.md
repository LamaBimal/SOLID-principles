# Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

One class should only serve one purpose, this does not imply that each class should have only one method 
but they should all relate directly to the responsibility of the class. 
All the methods and properties should all work towards the same goal.
 When a class serves multiple purposes or responsibility then it should be made into a new class.

There should be **Never** be more than **ONE** reason for a class to change.
